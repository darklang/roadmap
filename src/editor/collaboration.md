## Dark v1 problems

### Users can't see what changes were made, when, or by who?

**Problem:** when you go to look at some code, sometimes it looks wrong? Which idiot made that change (and was it, in fact, me)? Lacking the ability to see changes

**Solution: **store the user and the timestamp on ops

TODO: notifications for changes. Look at what notion/slack does, work in github too.
