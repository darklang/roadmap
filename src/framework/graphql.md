# GraphQL

### Dark v1 problems

### No GraphQL

**Problem:** GraphQL is one of the most asked-for additions to Dark. It's also a massively growing area, that promises to reduce accidental complexity compared to REST/JSON APIs. Dark has no GraphQL ability, though users have built GraphQL APIs on Dark.

**Solution:** Design an easy way to create GraphQL APIs for types and DBs. (As a non-expert, I hope this is a place the community will make suggestions).
