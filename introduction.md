# Introduction

This document is to describe the "2nd" version of Dark. The intent is to document the vision for Dark in the future, which can then be used to design a path from v1 to v2.

This document is being written simultaneously with "writing" a few Dark applications. I say writing because they are being written not against a real implementation, but on paper, to try and articulate the design of the language without getting bogged down on the implementation \(v1 of Dark has an implementation which I already have a lot of experience with\).

After this chapter, the rest of this document is organized by feature - we discuss what we learned from Dark v1 and what problems users experienced, then explain what we believe the solution is. Finally, each section will have a spec for v2 of the feature. This will expand to \(or possibly link to\) an implementation plan to migrate from v1 to v2.
